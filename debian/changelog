ros-indigo-play-motion (0.4.1-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Migrate to format2
  * remove module file
  * Add missing configuration for depender projects
  * Refactor argument names to convention
  * Add function alternatives where NodeHandle defaults to one of play_motion
  * log error when core is 0
  * Add default values and units to sample config.
  * Add new optional config parameter.
    Add new parameter to configure the minimum approach time to use when
    skip_planning = true.
    If we time-parameterize trajectories using MoveIt's built-in methods, we'd
    be able to get rid of this additional parameter, but in the meantime, it
    addresses an important issue.

ros-indigo-play-motion (0.3.1-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Populate velocity data
    
      * Velocities are populated only for motions that don't specify velocities for at least one waypoint.
      * Good compromise: Smoother than Fritsch-Butland, while still allowing to hold position in equal consecutive waypoints (one of the heuristics we wanted).

ros-indigo-play-motion (0.3.0-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Add include dirs to unit tests
  * Document IsAlreadyThere service
  * Add service IsAlreadyThere
  * Changed error codes to follow ROS standard. SUCCEEDED should be 1 (so we don't have 0 as a real error code as it's a default value).
  * Return SUCCEEDED when everything went fine
  * use CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING in CMakeLists.txt
  * catkin-only version now
